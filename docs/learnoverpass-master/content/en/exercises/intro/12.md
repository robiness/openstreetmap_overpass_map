“Uaaghhh! What happened to my map!” Bob exclaims as he saw the now empty map view.

So you see, using a bare `out` statement produced an empty map.

See, our `out` statement `print`s out the data that it receives, that is, if it can. A way only carries a reference to the list of nodes that make up for it - try clicking the ‘data’ button on the top right of the map view. This will show you the raw ‘data’ that overpass returns. Go ahead, try it.

Ack! It might look a bit complicated, but the basic thing that we have to look into here is that the way, has a list of nodes (nd). So you see, we actually just queried for the `way`, specifically, the list of nodes that make it up.

Let’s change our query back again to see the route.
