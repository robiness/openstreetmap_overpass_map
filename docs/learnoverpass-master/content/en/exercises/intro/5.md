    1. Around is a filter which queries for anything around our existing _result set_ (in this case our tree node). Since our result set is given by our first line, we need to make another statement. To do this, create a new line after the first line, so you have a blank 2nd line.
    2. Unlike `by tag` filters, around filters are surrounded by parenthesis, and follows the format `(around:n)` where `n` is your distance radius in meters. Let’s try setting the distance radius to 50.
    3. On your 2nd line, go ahead and write `node` followed by your around `filter`. Make sure to follow the format in 2!
    4. Don’t forget to add a semicolon to end your statement!
hint: Remember to make a new query statement! Don't just add around to the first line.

"Woah, it’s empty! Could it be that there are no restaurants near me?” asks Bob.

Not really. See, our first statement `node(2190458950)` is _already_ a node, so filtering it further wouldn’t do anything! And since we added a new filter (restaurants) to a statement that we __know__ gives us a tree, we basically asked OSM to further filter our result set (a tree node) to only show restaurants, which obviously results in OSM nothing (since a tree is not a restaurant)!

Our previous examples worked because we filtered for nodes with tags present in an _area_ (the `bounding box` with lat/lon points). We essentially queried for nodes in an area, then used filters to filter it down to a tree.

Right now, since our node is already a node, we can’t just use a filter to get a restaurant from it. We have to get a new _area_ from the node.

To do this, we can make great use of another filter, named `around`.
