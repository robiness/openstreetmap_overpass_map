    1. Oops, looks like Bob is still in trouble! The money from his wallet was probably carried away as he swam back to the riverbank! Thankfully, his ATM cards are still intact, so Bob only needs to withdraw cash from an ATM machine near him.
    2. Bob says he saw an ATM machine on his way to the tower. He estimates that the ATM is 150m away, give or take.
    3. Starting from the fifth blank line, create a new `node around` query to print out the atm. ATMs are of key type `amenity`, and takes the key value `atm`.
    4. Make sure to print the resulting set with `out;`.
hint: Use an `around` query again
answer: |
    area[name=Inn];
    node(area)["tower:type"=observation];
    out;

    node(around:150)[amenity=atm];
    out;

“Thanks man!” Bob says as we query for the route back again. He follows it to reach the observatory tower. Once he reached the river bank, he decides to leave his bike and _swim_ to the observatory!

After a few minutes, Bob comes back, shivering and wet.

“Brrrr… water’s cold!” Bob exclaims, when, out of nowhere, the waiter from the restaurant, all in white attire, appareas. He actually followed Bob all this way!

“Sir” the waiter says, panting “I still need that 25 euroes!”. “Yeah, surely” Bob says as he grabbed his wet wallet from his pocket.

“Oh” a deadpan expression comes from him. “Sorry, it seemed that I lost all my money swimming back here!”

Waiter: *Facepalm*
