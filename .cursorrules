If asked to start the app. It always means starting it as a web app in chrome with wasm enabled on port 3000. If port 3000 is used already we kill the process and start the app again.
We do not use build methods. Instead of creating a _build method we create a new Widget.
To run build runner or  generate and regenerate data classes always use 'flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs'
